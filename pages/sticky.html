<p> flowers are an essential part of our lives. 
They are responsible for bringing happiness in our lives and making our surrounding environment a prettier place to live in.
Thus, we must all plant flowers at homes and in our neighbourhood to beautify the place and bring happiness and joy for everyone passing by.

<p>Animals carry a lot of importance in our lives. 
They offer humans with food and many other things. 
For instance, we consume meat, eggs, dairy products.
Animals are multicellular eukaryotes whose cells are bound together by collagen. 
Animals dominate human conceptions of life on Earth because of their size, diversity, abundance, and mobility

<p>Food is a basic necessity of life that provides energy and nutrients for growth, repair, 
 and maintenance of the body. It is made up of water, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, minerals, and organic substances
 Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism.
 It can be raw, processed, or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth, health, or pleasure. 
 Food is mainly composed of water, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates.
 Eating food not just satisfies one's tummy but also provides the necessary nutrients for consumption. 
 However, eating proper food during the growing years enhances the overall development of kids. It boosts their metabolism 
 and provides them with energy when all the nutrients are consumed in proper quantities.

<p>An airplane (North American English) or aeroplane (British English), informally plane, is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet.
An airplane is a vehicle that has wings and one or more engines and
is capable of moving through the air. The word aircraft is also commonly used to refer to planes, though it can actually be used for other types of vehicles, such as helicopters.
The term airplane, which is often shortened to plane, usually refers to any type of power-driven aircraft that has fixed wings and is heavier than air. 
An airplane moves through the air with the help of its engine and wings.
The wings are shaped in a particular way so that air flows over them and gives them lift.
airplane, any of a class of fixed-wing aircraft that is heavier than air, propelled by a screw propeller or a high-velocity jet, and supported by the dynamic reaction of the air against its wings.
For an account of the development of the airplane and the advent of civil aviation see history of flight.
A plane, in geometry, prolongs infinitely in two dimensions. 
It has no width. We can see an example of a plane in coordinate geometry. 
The coordinates define the position of points in a plane. 
In Maths, a plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that prolongs infinitely far.
